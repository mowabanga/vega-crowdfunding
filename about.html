                <p>Hi. I'm Mundia. I'm the founder of Vega. Anout 13 years ago, as a hot headed teenager, I secretly watched 'The Wolf of WallStreet' and it clicked, or so I thought. See, if Leonardo di Caprio could make millions of dollars by simply buying penny stocks, then so could I.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>The very next morning, over breakfast, I was engrossed in the Daily Nation, particularly the stock market section. I was hooked. I was going to make it. I was going to be a stock market wizard. But I didn't have the money, or even the legal age to open a trading account, and that's where my dad came in. The whole process was a bit cumbersome, but we got it done. I was 14, and I was a trader. My dad, loaded the account with KES 100,000, and bought Uchumi shares, cause they were damn cheap and well, I was a bit of a stock market wizard, I was 100% certain that we would make millions before I resumed school for the second term. We lost it all...</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Fast forward, 13 years later, almost a decade and a half, I'm still very much in love with the markets, and I'm still learning. I've made some good money, I've lost some good money, but I'm still here. I'm still learning. I'm still trading. And I'm still dreaming.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>So, here we are. Vega is my attempt at building a unified platform that will unite the stock markets in East Africa, and maybe soon, across the whole of Africa one day.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>The MVP app is still a work in progress, and it's bloody expensive, I've already sunk in my whole life savings in this, and it still won't be enough, in fact, it's a drop in the ocean. Hence why I'm reaching out to you, whatever little you can contribute, please do, and if you can't, then maybe a word of ecouragement will go a long way. Thank you for reading this far, and I hope to see you on the other side.</p>
                <br/>

                        PS: I'm still learning, and I'm still trading. And I'm still dreaming. I promise not to use your funds for anything but the app, and I promise to be transparent about the numbers. Meaning I won't take women to Dubai or is it India, and when you sue me for embezzlement, I'll just laugh at you, then unappologetically go to Dubai, jetski, and ride on quad bikes in the desert, all funds will go to the app development process.
